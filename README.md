# beancount-importers-il

Collection of my beancount importers. They parse PDF files from following
Israeli institutions:
 - Bank Otzer / FIBI
 - Isracard
 - Visa CAL

Those parsers contain some ad hoc solutions for the examples I got, and might
not work for others.

Those parsers require the `pdfplumber` library, and pdfminer library with my
fixes for Hebrew support.
